Solver_2D_2.py must be downloaded in the folder.
Files starting with 2602 daytime should be run first, then the simulated results of growth rate, elements allocation and N2 fixation can be obtained.
2602 figures_Fig3.py can plot figure 3, and figure 2c,d
2602 figures_Nfixation_FigS2.py can plot figure S2
2602 O2_comparison.py and 2602 O2_comparison.py can simulated O2 results for 120s under H1, rapid mode
Then run 2602 O2_figure_Fig2b.py to obtain figure figure 2b
2603 O2_comparison.py and 2603 O2_comparison.py can simulated O2 results for 120s under H2, rapid mode
Then run 2603 O2_figure_Fig2b.py to obtain figure figure S1b
2602_comparison_to_experiment.py can plot figure S3
2602 figures_Nfixation_FigS2.py can plot figure S2
